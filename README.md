# Smart-Home-Automation-Project
This project is implemented using Arduino in tinkercad.
It is an implementation for a smart home, where by using specific sensors, automated responses will occur when needed. For instance, if the temperature increases above a limit, the fan will automatically turn on, and if there was movement in a specific area, then the door will open, also if there was a movement and no enough light was presented, then a bulb will turn on. Additionally, this project allows the user to control the responses for the devices when needed by sending notifications.
